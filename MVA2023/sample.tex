\section*{\centering Abstract}
\textit{
  The emergence of machine learning has revolutionized the world of digital 
  art, providing people with the ability to create highly polished images 
  without advanced drawing skills. 
  However, most of the studies that have been conducted to generate pictures 
  using machine learning are not tools that can be used by people who are 
  already working as creators, such as changing images to artistic styles or 
  generating images based on text. In this study, we propose a model that 
  learns brush styles of human paintings and generates new input images that 
  are redrawn using the learned brush styles. 
  The generated images by the proposed model are not perfect imitations of 
  the brush style of the reference image. This is thought to be caused by 
  the limitation of the model to generate flexible strokes due to minimal 
  stroke parameters.
  % Our model has the potential to significantly streamline the process of picture creation for creators, offering a powerful new tool for artists and designers alike.

\section{Introduction}
It is said that in order for people to paint a good picture, they need 
to master many techniques, which takes a long time. However, with the 
advancements in machine learning, it is now possible for people without 
painting skills to generate high-quality paintings. 
For example, Midjourney\cite{Midjourney} is a software application that 
allows users to create wonderful paintings by simply entering words, 
sentences, or keywords that describe the image they wish to have painted. 
However, it is difficult to say that such a tool is useful for creators who 
have already established their own style. For creators, it is important to 
create works by their own hands, whether digital or analog, and a tool like 
Midjourney, which relies on machine learning for the entire picture creation 
process, is likely to leave creators dissatisfied with the shape and color 
of the drawn objects. Therefore, we aim to conduct research that can support 
creators during their work. Our goal is to develop a model that learns the 
brush style of a picture drawn by a creator and adapts the brush style to a 
new image. In this study, we propose a model that takes two input images, 
a content reference image and a style reference image, and generates an image 
in which what was drawn in the content reference image is redrawn with the 
brush style of the style reference image. 
Figure {fig:haru} shows examples of two input images and an output image.
The picture shown in the content reference image was created with a solid 
coloring brush, so the boundary between colors is always clear. The picture 
shown in the style reference image was created using a brush with a texture 
similar to that of an analog picture, so it is possible to make a gradation 
between colors. The generated image is a 
representation of the one drawn in the content reference image with the 
brush style of the style reference image.
It is expected that creators can greatly streamline the process of creating 
pictures by manually creating images like the content reference image shown 
in Figure\ref{fig:haru} using a simple brush, and then inputting it into the 
model to have it redrawn with the creator's brush style. Since the content 
reference image is created by the creator, the shape and color of the object 
can be controlled by the creator, and any dissatisfaction with the generated 
image can be resolved with some modifications.

\section{Related Works}
The use of machine learning to generate paintings has been heavily researched 
and has made significant progress. The method using neural networks as a 
generative tool is typically formulated as a pixel-wise mapping \cite{PerceptualLosses} 
or a continuous optimization process in pixel space \cite{ImageStyleTransfer}.
However, it is difficult for a neural network to imitate the process that a 
human draws. Humans typically start 
by applying rough colors and then gradually adding details, while neural 
networks generate images pixel by pixel. To imitate the human drawing 
process, the machine would have the ability to decompose a given image into 
an ordered sequence of strokes. While neural networks can create sketches 
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/HaE17}, \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1805-00247} 
and doodles \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-05977} with a small number of 
strokes, creating a texture-rich painting requires many more strokes.
This makes it difficult to set loss functions for each stroke and prepare 
ground-truth strokes. As a result, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often used 
to decompose strokes in texture-rich images. \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1804-01118, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1206-4634, Huang_2019_ICCV}
Because the computational cost is high in the learning process of an RL agent, 
there are also studies that have formulated this process as a stroke 
parameter search. \cite{PaintTransformer}
The brush style transfers addressed in this paper are similar to those 
addressed in Neural Style Transfer \cite{ImageStyleTransfer}, in which the 
overall mood of an input style image (such as a painting) is transferred to 
another image, using CNNs. The model proposed in that study can transform a 
landscape photograph into an artistic style, but the atmosphere and colors of 
the style reference image as a whole are transferred to the content reference 
image. Therefore, characteristic objects depicted in the style reference 
image, which are not present in the content reference image, appear in the 
output image from the model. 
In this study, we aim to only transfer the style of the brush without changing 
the contents and colors drawn in the content reference image. We addressed 
this issue by adopting the Transformer-based stroke generation pipeline 
proposed by Liu \textit{et al}.\cite{PaintTransformer} as a stroke prediction 
model for our proposed model.

\section{Methodology}
The proposed model utilizes a Transformer-based framework called Paint 
Transformer proposed by Liu et al.\cite{PaintTransformer} as a stroke prediction 
pipeline. The ultimate aim of this research is to create a model that can 
redraw the content depicted in a content reference image using the brush 
style of a style reference image. To achieve this goal, we used a method 
of alternating optimization of stroke and brush parameters.
Here, stroke parameters refer to parameters such as the color and size of 
strokes that are different for each stroke, while brush parameters refer to 
parameters common to all strokes, such as the base brush image.

Paint Transformer, used as a stroke prediction pipeline, is a Transformer-based 
framework. This framework generates a sequence of strokes by predicting 
stroke parameters of multiple strokes using a forward propagating transformer.
Paint Transformer consists of two modules: a stroke predictor and a stroke 
renderer. 
A stroke consists of eight parameters: center coordinates $x$, $y$, height $h$,
width $w$, rotation angle $\theta$, and $r$, $g$, $b$ corresponding to RGB values 
representing colors. Thus, stroke $s$ can be expressed as \{ $x$, $y$, $h$, $w$, $\theta$, $r$, $g$, $b$\}.
The strokes rendered by Paint Transformer are monochromatic strokes that are 
scaled and rotated from the base brush image. 
Paint Transfomer generates multiple strokes based on eight randomly generated 
parameters and uses them as a training dataset to train a stroke predictor. 
Since the training dataset is generated randomly and automatically, there is 
no need to prepare a dataset. 

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=80mm]{resource/brushes.eps}
  \caption{Diversity of brushes developed for more accurate representation of painting effects.}
  \label{fig:brushes}
\end{figure}


Paint Transformer used a single brush image to generate strokes. 
We newly created six types of brush images. Figure \ref{fig:brushes} shows 
the seven brush images. (a) is the brush image used by Liu et al. and (b)-(g) 
are the newly created ones. In (a)-(c), brush images are provided for each 
horizontal stroke and each vertical stroke.


The Brush Style Transfer model architecture is shown in Figure \ref{fig:final_model}.
The upper part of the figure shows the flow of brush parameter optimization and 
the lower part shows the flow of stroke parameter optimization. 
To perform Brush Style Transfer, we utilize seven brush images and execute 
Paint Transformer algorithm seven times. The input image for each Paint Transformer 
execution is the style reference image. We then calculate the style similarity 
between the output images and the style reference image. Based on this similarity, 
we determine the brush image that can draw brush strokes closest to the brush 
style of the style reference image. Next, we use the content reference image as 
the input image and execute Paint Transformer algorithm using the selected brush 
image. The resulting output is an image that depicts the content of the 
content reference image with the brush style of the style reference image.

The parameter optimized in this process is denoted by $S$ and consists of 
brush parameters $S^g$ and stroke parameters $S^l$. $S^g$ and $S^l$ are 
represented as $S^g \in \{g_1,g_2,..,g_7\}$, $S^l=\{x, y, h, w, \theta, r, g, b\}$, 
where $g_1, g_2,...g_7$ are each of the brush images.
Since the brush parameters are common to all brush strokes, the i-th stroke 
$S_i$ is represented as $S_i = {S_i^l, S^g}$. The optimization of brush 
parameters and stroke parameters are performed by the following equations.

\begin{equation}
  S^g = \mathop{\rm argmin}\limits_{S^g}(\mathop{\rm min}\limits_{S_i^l}(L(\{\bar{S_i^l}, \bar{S^g}\}, I_{style})))
  \label{eq_first}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  S_i^l = \mathop{\rm argmin}\limits_{S_i^l}(L(\{\bar{S_i^l}, S^g\}, I_{content}))
  \label{eq_second}
\end{equation}

Here, $I_{style}$ and $I_{content}$  represent the style reference image and 
content reference image, respectively. $S^g$ in Equation \eqref{eq_second} 
refers to the $S^g$ calculated in Equation \eqref{eq_first}.
% \begin{equation}
%   \phi = \mathop{\rm argmin}\limits_{\phi}(\mathop{\rm argmin}\limits_{e}(L(x^{\prime}, x)) + R(e))
% \end{equation}

% Here, $L$ is the content loss and $R$ is the stroke regularization term. By 
% inputting a style reference image $x$ as a content reference image into the 
% Paint Transformer and obtaining the result $x^{\prime}$, we can determine the 
% optimal stroke parameters $e$ and then use them, along with the regularization term, 
% to determine the optimal brush parameters $\phi$.
% Next, the content reference image is input to Paint Transformer. At this time, 
% the brush parameters optimized earlier are used. The output is used to optimize 
% the stroke parameters. The optimization of the stroke parameters is performed 
% using the following equation.

% \begin{equation}
%   e = \mathop{\rm argmin}\limits_{e}(L(y^{\prime}, y) + \psi(x, y^{\prime}))
% \end{equation}

% Here, $L$ is the content loss and $\psi$ is the style loss. These are used to 
% find the optimal stroke parameters $e$.
% The above two optimizations are repeated alternately to bring the brush and 
% stroke parameters closer to the optimum.


% \subsection{Structure of the proposed model}
% As mentioned earlier, double optimization has not been implemented at this 
% stage. In the proposed model, multiple base brush images are prepared, and 
% the final output image is the one with the highest similarity of brush style 
% with the style reference image among the results of multiple runs of Paint 
% Transformer using those images. 
% Paint Transformer is used for the stroke prediction model, and a function to 
% evaluate the similarity of the style with the style reference image is added 
% to the part after stroke prediction by Paint Transformer using the seven 
% types of brush images described below.

  \includegraphics[width=80mm]{resource/dataset.eps}
  \caption{Content reference image and style reference image used in the experiment.}
  \label{fig:inputs}
\end{figure}

% \subsection{Loss Function}
% The $L1$ loss of the Gram matrix is employed as a loss function to evaluate 
% the brush style of the output image generated by the Paint Transformer and 
% the style reference image. We judged that the Gram matrix is suitable for 
% the evaluation of brush styles because it allows us to consider a wide range 
% of image correlations.

\section{Experiments and Results}

\subsection{Experiments}
The proposed model takes a content reference image and a style reference image, 
and outputs a result image. For the content images, we used one cat image from 
The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset \cite{oxford-dataset}.
The content reference image and style reference image used are shown in Figure \ref{fig:inputs}.
Image (b) is \textit{Composition with Red,
Blue, and Yellow} by Piet Mondrian, 1930. Image (c) is \textit{The Starry Night} 
by Vincent van Gogh, 1889.

\subsection{Results}
When the seven brush images shown in Figure \ref{fig:brushes} were used to 
generate strokes that represent the content reference image shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:inputs}, the image with the highest similarity to the style reference 
image is shown in (a) of Figure \ref{fig:result}. 
These brush styles are not very similar, which can be attributed to the fact 
that there were only seven base brush images and the parameters used to represent 
the strokes were minimal. It can be confirmed that the content of the output 
image has not changed significantly from that of the content reference image.
Image \ref{fig:result}, (b) is the output image obtained when the content 
reference image is inputted to Neural Style Transfer \cite{ImageStyleTransfer}.
The brush style is imitated 
with high accuracy, but the color has changed from the original content 
reference image and the stars drawn in the style reference image have appeared.

\section{Discussion and Limitations}
In this study, we proposed a novel approach to transform the content of a 
content reference image into a style that imitates the brush style of a style 
reference image using a forward propagating neural network. 
We used a Transformer-based framework called Paint Transformer to redraw the 
content drawn in the content reference image using the brush style of the 
style reference image. In the proposed model, since the stroke 
prediction model was trained using Paint Transformer as it is, the stroke 
parameters are the same as those of Paint Transformer, i.e., five shape 
parameters and three color parameters, for a total of eight. In future studies, 
we believe that adding more parameters will enable more flexible brush stroke 
representation. The strokes generated by the proposed model are created by 
scaling and rotating the brush images shown in Figure\ref{fig:brushes}, but 
strokes can also be generated by connecting multiple brush images in 
succession. For example, CLIP STUDIO PAINT \cite{ClipStudio}, a paint software, 
can draw strokes as shown in the upper right of Figure\ref{fig:discussion}, but simply 
adjusting the size of the brush image cannot generate similar strokes, 
resulting in strokes like the one shown in the lower right of Figure\ref{fig:discussion}.
It is expected that by increasing the number of stroke parameters, we can 
increase the expressiveness of the brush and generate strokes like the one 
in the upper right of Figure\ref{fig:discussion}, which imitate the brush style of the 
style reference image.
