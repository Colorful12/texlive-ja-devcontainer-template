\section{Image Style Transfer}
　Gatys \textit{et al}. \cite{Gatys_2016_CVPR} introduced \textit{A Neural Algorithm of Artistic 
Style} which enables the creation of novel images that seamlessly blend the subject 
matter of a photograph with the artistic style of a famous artwork.
In rendering the semantic content of an image in various styles, the problem was
the lack of effective image representations that can explicitly encode semantic information 
and separate image content and style. 
\textit{A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style} \cite{Gatys_2016_CVPR} is able to analyze the 
visual characteristics of an image and separate them into two distinct components
: the content and the style.
The content refers to the subject or object depicted in the image, while the style 
refers to the visual techniques manifested in a painting, such as touch and mood.

How to achieve that in detail.
